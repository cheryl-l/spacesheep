    <h1> About Us: spacesheep </h1>
    <img src = "assets/picofus.png" alt="group picture of spacesheep">
    <p> We are Cheryl, Janessa, Karin, Phoebe and Sarah from Raffles Girls' School, class of 2020. We participated in DSTA Virtual YDSP Science and Technology Camp, where we learnt a multitude of new skills - from app prototyping with figma, to website creation in HTML/CCS/Javascript, to Artificial Intelligence with google colab. The camp, centred around the theme SpaceCube Mission, naturally also taught us valuable and fundamental knowledge about satellites and space technology. Equipped with this new knowledge and armed with new skills, we worked together to create this website to share interesting nuggests of information! </p>
    <p> In addition to our website, we created an agriculture satellite observatory app that allows farmers and fishermen to monitor their livestock and track their movements. It also provides the risks that they may face, as well as some recommendations to reduce it. Do check it out <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/qGqSxv8k0KbeUANHe4TdEK/spacesheep-prototype?node-id=103%3A517&scaling=scale-down">here!</a></p>

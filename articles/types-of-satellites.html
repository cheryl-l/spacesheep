    <h1> Types of Satellites </h1>
    <img src = "../assets/thumbnails/011.jpg" alt="image of satellite">
    
    <h2> Astronomical Satellites </h2>
        <p> They are satellites for space observation which can produce real-time images of the observations of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects, to understand their behaviour and predict future astronomical events precisely. It defeated the prime hindrance of observing the planets from the earth which were the dense atmospheric layers near the earth surface filled with dust and pollution. </p>
        <p>Photo creation methods - An Astronomical satellite is designed and placed in the earth’s orbit to continuously monitor the astronomical events or a specific planet. The satellite employs electromagnetic spectrum analysis methods for wavelength regions such as Ultra violet, X-ray, visible spectrum, microwaves and gamma rays to take images of the solar objects. </p>
        <p> Applications: </p>
        <ul> 
        <li> <b> Star Mapping: </b> They are used for observing the earth or any other star and can, therefore be used for mapping the stars in the cosmos.</li>
        <li> <b> Observe Black Holes and the Quasars formations: </b>  They are used to study and research the various stages of black hole formation or the other significant solar activities. </li>
        <li> <b> Taking Photos and analysing thb: </b> Taking photos for comparison of size and shapes before and after an astronomical event and highlighting the changes in the locations of the planets and galaxies is one of the main objectives of using them. </li>
        <li> <b> Forecasting through observation: </b> The precise calculations on the basis of exact locations of the planets can predict the cosmological events such as a comet collision or meteors shower. These predictions help us to be prepared for any chain effects on the earth due to the events in space. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> They have been instrumental in studying the mysteries related to our cosmos such as the various states of a star (i.e. red giant, supernova, black hole among many others). The precise mapping of the star's surface, their patterns, and 3D location tracking have revealed various new concepts in cosmology and corroborated many old theories. </p>
        <p> Usefulness of satellite images of the earth: The scientific understanding of earth surface and changes after natural disasters are studied through the satellite photos of the earth. Astronomical satellites not only provide information regarding the outer universe but also play a vital role in understanding the phenomenon that affects the earth such as natural disasters. Earth mapping using satellites can enhance our understanding of the industrial side effects on our planet and warn us for the drastic rise in sea levels and submerged land masses due to the burning of fossil fuels. Therefore, if utilised efficiently, they can be of significant use in sustaining the balance of life on earth or maybe on other planets as well.</p>
    
    <h2> Biosatellites </h2>
        <p> They are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation. More specifically, they determine the effects of space environment, particularly weightlessness, on life processes at three levels of organisation: basic biochemistry of the cell; structure of growth of cells and tissues; and growth and form of entire plants and animals. </p>
        
    <h2> Communication Satellites </h2>
        <p> Communication satellites are artificial earth satellites that facilitate communications, as radio, television, and telephone transmissions, by means of the reflection or the amplification and retransmission of signals between stations on earth or in space, by creating a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Many are in geostationary orbit, 35,785 km above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky, so the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it. </p>
        <p> The high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth. The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points. To avoid signal interference, international organisations have regulations for which frequency ranges or "bands" certain organisations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimises the risk of signal interference. </p>
        <p> There are two main types of satellites, passive and active. Passive satellites reflect the signal from the source to the receiver, while active satellites amplify the signal radio telecommunications signals via a transponder. Most satellites used now are active. </p>
        <p> The main purpose of satellite communication is to make communication easier and faster. Using a satellite network, the same broadcast can reach billions of people, and satellite communication can provide access to phone, internet, and television services to people, while having military applications as well. There are about 2,000 communications satellites in Earth's orbit, used by both private and government organisations. Given the increase in use of satellite communication, it promises to be an industry that will continue to grow and provide more options for users. </p>
        <p> Communications Satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems: </p>
        <ul> 
        <li> <b> Communication Payload</b>, normally composed of transponders, antennas, and switching systems
        <li> <b> Engines</b> used to bring the satellite to its desired orbit </li>
        <li>  A station keeping <b>tracking and stabilisation subsystem</b> used to keep the satellite in the right orbit, with its antennas pointed in the right direction, and its power system pointed towards the sun</li>
        <li> <b> Power subsystem</b>, used to power the Satellite systems, normally composed of solar cells, and batteries that maintain power during solar eclipse. </li>
        <li> <b> Command and Control subsystem</b>, which maintains communications with ground control stations. The ground control Earth stations monitor the satellite performance and control its functionality during various phases of its life-cycle. </li> 
        </ul>

    <h2>Earth observation (EO) Satellites </h2>
        <p> They are satellites intended for long-term global observations from orbit such as environmental monitoring (biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, etc), meteorology and map making etc. </p>
        <p> The most common type are Earth imaging satellites that take satellite images, analogous to aerial photographs. Some EO satellites may perform remote sensing without forming pictures, such as in GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) radio occultation. </p>
        <p> Most Earth observation satellites carry instruments that should be operated at a relatively low altitude. Altitudes below 500-600 kilometers are in general avoided, though, because of the significant air-drag at such low altitudes making frequent orbit reboost maneuvers necessary. </p>
        <p> Applications of EO satellites: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Weather satellites </li> <ul>
                <li> Weather satellites are used to monitor the weather and climate of the Earth, including cloud systems, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc. </li>
                <li> Visible-light images from weather satellites during local daylight hours of clouds, cloud systems such as fronts and tropical storms, lakes, forests, mountains, snow ice, fires, and pollution such as smoke, smog, dust and haze are readily apparent. Even wind can be determined by cloud patterns, alignments and movement from successive photos. </li>
                <li> The thermal or infrared images recorded by sensors called scanning radiometers enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. Infrared satellite imagery can be used effectively for tropical cyclones with a visible eye pattern. Using color-digitised techniques, the gray shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information. </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Environmental Monitoring </li> <ul> 
                <li>Detecting changes in the Earth's vegetation, atmospheric trace gas content, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields. By monitoring vegetation changes over time, droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average. </li></ul>
            <li> Terrain mapping </li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Miniaturised Satellites </h2>
        <p> These include satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes. New classifications are used to categorise these satellites: minisatellite (500–1000 kg), microsatellite (below 100 kg), nanosatellite (below 10 kg). </p> 
        <p> Satellites can be built small to reduce the large economic cost, as heavier satellites require larger rockets with greater thrust that also have greater cost. In contrast, smaller and lighter satellites require smaller and cheaper launch vehicles and can sometimes be launched in multiples. They can also be launched 'piggyback', using excess capacity on larger launch vehicles. Miniaturised satellites allow for cheaper designs and ease of mass production. </p> 
        <p> Another major reason for developing small satellites is the opportunity to enable missions that a larger satellite could not accomplish, such as: </p> <ul>
            <li> Constellations for low data rate communications </li>
            <li> Using formations to gather data from multiple points </li>
            <li> In-orbit inspection of larger satellites </li>
            <li> University-related research </li>
            <li> Testing or qualifying new hardware before using it on a more expensive spacecraft </li> </ul>
        <p> Miniature satellites, especially in large numbers, may be more useful than fewer, larger ones for some purposes, for example, gathering of scientific data and radio relay. Technical challenges in the construction of small satellites may include the lack of sufficient power storage or of room for a propulsion system. </p> 
        <h2> Reconnaissance Satellites </h2>
        <p> They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites deployed for military or intelligence applications. Very little is known about the full power of these satellites, as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified. </p>
        <p> Types of Reconnaissance satellites: </p>
            <li> <b> Missile early warning </b> -- provides warning of an attack by detecting ballistic missile launches. </li>
            <li> <b> Nuclear explosion detection </b> -- identifies and characterises nuclear explosions in space. </li>
            <li> <b> Electronic reconnaissance </b> -- signals intelligence, intercepts stray radio waves. </li>
            <li> <b> Optical imaging surveillance </b> -- provides imaging of earth from space. Images can be a survey or close-look telephoto. </li>

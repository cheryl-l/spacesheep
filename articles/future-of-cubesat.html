    <h1> Future of Cubesats </h1>
    <img src = "../assets/thumbnails/017.jpg" alt="coloured earth with satellite">
    <p>Other goals relate to the use of CubeSats as constellations or swarms deploying tens to hundreds of CubeSats that function as one distributed array of measurements.</p>

    <p>The set of science goals where the use of CubeSats have enabled is evolving too quickly for the committee to create a comprehensive list, and the committee was not tasked with prioritising CubeSat missions. However, the following examples provide a sampling of high-priority science goals that could potentially be pursued using CubeSats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Solar and space physics, Earth science and applications from space—Exploration of Earth’s atmospheric boundary region.</b> CubeSats are uniquely suited because of their expendability to explore the scientific processes that shape the upper atmospheric boundary using short-lifetime, low-altitude orbits. </li>
        <li> <b>Earth science and applications from space—Multipoint, high temporal resolution of Earth processes.</b> Satellite constellations in low Earth orbit could provide both global and diurnal observations of Earth processes that vary throughout the day, such as severe storms, and are currently under-sampled by Sun-synchronous observatories.</li>
        <li> <b>Planetary science—In situ investigation of the physical and chemical properties of planetary surfaces or atmospheres. </b> Deployable (daughter-ship) CubeSats could expand the scope of the motherships with complementary science or site exploration. </li>
        <li> <b>Astronomy and astrophysics, solar and space physics—Low-frequency radio science. </b> Interferometers made of CubeSats could explore the local space environment and also galactic and extragalactic sources with spatial resolution in ways not accessible from Earth. </li>
        <li> <b>Biological and physical sciences in space—Investigate the survival and adaptation of organisms to space.</b> CubeSats offer a platform to understand the effects of the environment encountered in deep space, such as microgravity and high levels of radiation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To unlock the science potential of CubeSats or missions relying on CubeSat technology, federal investments continue to be crucial, especially in areas that will not see commercial investment. Both NSF and NASA have active CubeSat programs. NSF’s program has the dual goals of supporting small satellite missions to advance space weather-related research and of providing opportunities to train the next generation of experimental space scientists and aerospace engineers. As of 2015, NSF had launched 8 science-based CubeSat missions (consisting of 13 CubeSat spacecraft) and has 7 missions (11 CubeSat spacecraft) in development. The committee believes that the program has been successful with regard to both goals and that NSF’s current program continues to be valuable. The program is particularly well aligned with the goals and recommendations of the 2013 decadal survey for solar and space physics, Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society (National Research Council, The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C.); however, other disciplines at NSF, such as Earth science and astronomy and astrophysics, could also benefit from the scientific and educational opportunities that CubeSats provide. </p>
    <p>The rapidly increasing potential of CubeSats as a platform for scientific discovery translates into a need for better coordination and management at NASA. Spacecraft development, launch and radio license approvals, technology development, and mission operations efforts to support scientific CubeSat missions are being duplicated at multiple centers and at investigator facilities. </p>

    <h1> Applications of CubeSat </h1>

    <p> Historically, CubeSats were developed as training projects to expose students to the challenges of real-world engineering practices and system design. Yet, their use has rapidly spread within academia, industry, and government agencies both nationally and internationally. </p>

    <p> CubeSats enable us to affordably access space and perform unique measurements of scientific value, obtain high-priority science data, as defined in recent decadal surveys in astronomy and astrophysics, Earth science and applications from space, planetary science, and solar and space physics (heliophysics), and have the potential to advance biology and microgravity research. It provides a list of sample science goals for CubeSats, many of which address targeted science, often in coordination with other spacecraft, or use “sacrificial,” or high-risk, orbits that lead to the demise of the satellite after critical data have been collected. </p>

    <p>The rapid speed of CubeSat development has been enabled, in part, by fast “fly-learn-refly” cycles—in which two flight models are developed and the second model is modified and launched if issues arise during the first flight—comparatively low development costs, miniaturised electronics, and timely availability of affordable launch opportunities. </p>

    <p> A pioneering CubeSat-based research program launched in 2008 within NSF’s Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences was responsible for the first systematic support of CubeSat-based science investigations and led to a growing engagement with universities. Furthermore, a growing commercial sector for the use of CubeSats for Earth observations and remote sensing has also helped to spur rapid technology development. Commercial demand has given rise to a fast-growing component-supplier industry. These commercial users and suppliers are now major drivers of technology development for CubeSats, and many technologies or subsystems can be purchased “off the shelf” by groups that seek to use CubeSats to address science objectives. </p>

    <p> CubeSats have already produced high-value science. CubeSats are useful as instruments of targeted investigations to augment the capabilities of large missions and ground-based facilities. Due to their size, cost, and length of development cycle, CubeSats can transform the conduct of space science in two ways. First, they can enable some fraction of science traditionally done by larger and more expensive platforms to be conducted in more cost-effective ways. Second, CubeSats can enable and support science not feasible with traditional missions. It is via constellations of dozens or even hundreds of CubeSats where the most transformational science might be enabled. In space physics and Earth science especially, high-cadence, simultaneous multipoint measurements are essential for studying complicated, highly coupled systems, and these kinds of investigations so far have not been feasible. CubeSat-based constellations have the potential to provide important and truly enabling science capabilities in astronomy and planetary sciences—for example, by using instruments with distributed apertures such as radio interferometers. </p>
